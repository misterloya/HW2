Homework 2, Issac Loya, Portfolio 


Homework 2 was made for us to be able to showcase our ability to create a responsibe website from scratch that could feature our most recent works and that could
test our chops. I had a difficult time reatining information on flexbox, it's usage in position, and really understanding how to link clickable links to working projects. 
The projects that are featured in this portfolio aren't current as of 10/24/2020, but they will continue to be updated as the boot camp moves forward. 

I'm not in complete understanding yet on how to launch a website to a live URL, nor am I fully confident in organization of files through my github, but i feel confident that with 
practice I'll be able to become more efficient.
